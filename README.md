# Reth @ BSC

A BSC-compatible Reth client implementation. This project is **not** a fork of Reth, but rather an extension that leverages Reth's powerful `NodeBuilder` API to provide BSC compatibility.

## About

This project aims to bring Reth's high-performance Ethereum client capabilities to the BSC network. By utilizing Reth's modular architecture and NodeBuilder API, we're building a BSC-compatible client that maintains compatibility with Reth's ecosystem while adding BSC-specific features.

## Current Status

- Historical Sync ✅
- BSC Pectra Support ✅
- Live Sync ✅
- Run as validator ❌ (soon)

### Sync Status (as of September 1st, 2025)

- **BSC Mainnet**: Synced to the tip ✅ (10.6T disk required)
- **BSC Testnet**: Synced to the tip ✅ (800GB disk usage)

## Building

### Clone and Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bnb-chain/reth-bsc.git
cd reth-bsc

# use cargo
cargo build  # debug mode
cargo build --release  # release mode 

# use makefile
# release mode default. 
# cargo build --bin reth-bsc --features "jemalloc,asm-keccak" --profile "release"
make build

# build in max perf profile
# RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo build --bin reth-bsc --profile maxperf --features jemalloc,asm-keccak
make maxperf 
```

## Running

### Full Node (Recommended)

A full node stores recent state and can serve RPC requests efficiently:

```bash
./target/${profile}/reth-bsc node --full --chain bsc --datadir ./data_dir
```

### Archive Node

An archive node stores the complete blockchain history and state:

```bash
./target/${profile}/reth-bsc node --chain bsc --datadir ./data_dir
```

### BSC Testnet

To run on BSC Testnet instead of Mainnet, simply replace `--chain bsc` with `--chain bsc-testnet` in any of the above commands:

```bash
# Example: Full node on BSC Testnet
./target/${profile}/reth-bsc node --full --chain bsc-testnet --datadir ./data_dir
```

### RPC Configuration

To enable RPC services, add these parameters to your node command:

#### HTTP & Websocket
```bash
# Full node with HTTP and WebSocket RPC enabled
./target/${profile}/reth-bsc node --full \
  --chain bsc \
  --datadir ./data_dir \
  --http \
  --http.addr 0.0.0.0 \
  --http.port 8545 \
  --http.api eth,net,web3,txpool,debug \
  --ws \
  --ws.addr 0.0.0.0 \
  --ws.port 8546 \
  --ws.api eth,net,web3,txpool
```

### Available API Modules

- `eth`: Ethereum JSON-RPC API (block info, transactions, etc.)
- `net`: Network information (peer count, network ID)
- `web3`: Web3 standard APIs (client version, sha3)
- `txpool`: Transaction pool information
- `debug`: Debug APIs for development (tracing, profiling)
- `trace`: Transaction tracing (requires archive node)
- `admin`: Administrative APIs (peer management)


## Sync

### 1. Genesis Sync

Sync from block 0 (will take weeks):

```bash
./target/release/reth-bsc node --chain bsc --datadir=./data_dir
```

### 2. Snapshot Sync

Refer to the [SNAPSHOT.md](https://github.com/bnb-chain/reth-bsc/blob/main/SNAPSHOT.md) for snapshot information

## Monitoring

### Check Sync Status

```bash
# Check current block
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' \
  http://localhost:8545

# Check sync status
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_syncing","params":[],"id":1}' \
  http://localhost:8545
```

### Metrics

Enable metrics endpoint for monitoring:

```bash
--metrics 0.0.0.0:6060
```

Then access metrics at `http://localhost:6060/metrics`

### Logs

Enable detailed logging:

```bash
--log.file.verbosity debug \
--log.file.directory ./logs
```

### EVN Support

This client implements the BSC upgrade-status handshake extension. When EVN is enabled, the node requests peers to disable transaction broadcast towards it, mirroring the Enhanced Validator Network behavior used by validator/sentry nodes.

- Enable via CLI: `--evn.enabled`
- Or via env var: `BSC_EVN_ENABLED=true`
- EVN activates only after the node is synced (based on head timestamp lag). Override lag threshold via `BSC_EVN_SYNC_LAG_SECS` (default 30s). Existing peers are refreshed once EVN is armed.

Note: This currently affects the outgoing handshake signaling. Further EVN behaviors (e.g., peer whitelists, conditional broadcast policies) can be added incrementally.
